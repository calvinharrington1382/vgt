Words With Friends Cheat Words with Friends Cheat is a tool that helps you find words and answers for the famous Zynga game. It generates all possible words from the inputted letters so that you can pick the highest-scoring ones. Easy, intuitive, and free to use when you need to make words from letters or boost your game. You can use a Words With Friends cheat to search the dictionary for any combinations of letters. Just tell the solver which letters you have, and it will help you find words with the highest points. After you enter all your letters, it searches through the Scrabble dictionary, and pulls back a word list of every possible option you can make! The standard Words With Friends® game board is the same size as the Scrabble® board. The standard grid is 15 squares by 15 squares, adding up to squares in total. Some additional game modes, like the Solo Challenge, use a smaller 11 x 11 game board ( squares) for a tighter, faster-paced game.
