Super Hydorah, (iOS) Lazaretto Horror Game, (iOS) Donut County, (iOS) Sling Plane 3D, (iOS) Golf Club: Wasteland, (iOS) Chat Master!, (iOS) Dice Push, (iOS) Covet Fashion Cheats, (iOS) The Simpsons: Tapped Out, (iOS). Words With Friends  is optimized for Words With Friends 2 (a.k.a. WWF2), which you can find on your app store of choice. That said, this WWF wordfinder will still work well for any game you have. If you need help with a specific game, find our Also Available section below. The standard Words With Friends® game board is the same size as the Scrabble® board. The standard grid is 15 squares by 15 squares, adding up to squares in total. Some additional game modes, like the Solo Challenge, use a smaller 11 x 11 game board ( squares) for a tighter, faster-paced game.
