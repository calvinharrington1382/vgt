 · Install Cheat Engine. Double-click  file in order to open it. Click the PC icon in Cheat Engine in order to select the game process. Keep the list. Activate the trainer options by checking boxes or setting values from 0 to 1. You do not have the required permissions to view the files attached to this post. Top.  · C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XComGame\Config\ Secondly depending on if you want a Base command or a Field command your bindings need to be inserted like so: Base command: underneath the [Input] line Field command: underneath the Missing: long war.  · Xcom was made to be mod unfriendly so people really didnt bother. Long War mod does open up all the files though so you could go and edit them yourself. Otherwise move on to Xcom2 which is made to have mods and there are plenty of great ones. #1.
