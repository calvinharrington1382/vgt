 · Mario Kart Tour Guide: Tips, Cheats, and Strategies. by Glen Fox on at pm. Our Mario Kart Tour guide will help novices and experts alike get to grips with Nintendo’s latest.  · 3. Gyro Handling. Usually I'm not one to suggest motion controls for a Mario Kart game, but for Mario Kart Tour, I will make an exception. Manual drifting is the best way to drift, that's for certain, and for best control over your kart you should also be able to steer.
