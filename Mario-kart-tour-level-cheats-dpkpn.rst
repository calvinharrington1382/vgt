 · Mario Kart Tour is out right now, and while some have expressed complaints about the way it controls and the monetization (me), it's hard to argue with the fact that it is an authentic mobile Mario Kart experience. It has loads of courses, drift boosts, items, and will eventually have multiplayer.  · The Gold Pass is a subscription for Mario Kart Tour that costs $ and unlocks the cc mode, exclusive Gold Gifts and more. Considering it's a monthly cost, you might be on the fence about.  · Mario Kart Tour hit the market a few months back, and firmly split the Nintendo fanbase in two halves - those that could stomach the changes, and those that could not. Frankly, I don't think the game is all that bad, it makes for a nice adaptation of the Mario Kart formula to mobile, while introducing some new stages that really look great.
