Cheat Engine. Cheat Engine allows easy hacking of funds and other resources. After loading your game, use Cheat Engine to select the Xcom process, check your amount of funds and search for that value with Cheat Engine. Then spend some funds and search again for the new value and you should find the right memory location. To do this, open the file  located in the XEW\XComGame\Config folder.
