Beat Lavos while Chrono is 'dead'. Ending03 The Dream Project. Beat Lavos in the Black Omen OR right after Marle joins your party (New Game+ only) Ending04 The Successor of Guardia. Beat Lavos as soon as you return from AD [right telepod, again - only new game +] Ending05 Good Night.  · Hold the direction you have to go first. Avoid diagonals, do sharp direction changes. The rat slows down a bit when it turns. Auto-Run + A Button Mashing + sharp direction changes will help you%(57).
