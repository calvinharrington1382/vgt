 · Words With Friends Cheat. Words with Friends Cheat is a tool that helps you find words and answers for the famous Zynga game. It generates all possible words from the inputted letters so that you can pick the highest-scoring ones. Easy, intuitive, and free to use when you need to make words from letters or boost your game. This Words with Friends Cheat was specifically designed to help at Words with friends, but we also have a Scrabble Word Finder which is designed for Scrabble.. This helper takes the letters you have entered and matches them against the Words with Friends dictionary. Don't think of it as cheating, think of it as making the best use of your time to ensure that you land the word . Unscramble Letters, Play Words. The standard Words With Friends® game board is the same size as the Scrabble® board. The standard grid is 15 squares by 15 squares, adding up to squares in total. Some additional game modes, like the Solo Challenge, use a smaller 11 x 11 game board ( squares) for a tighter, faster-paced game.
