With a Words With Friends board editor, you can analyze the board and its possibilities in new ways. Finding words no longer has to be limited to what's in your rack like from an anagram solver. It takes into consideration all the words on the board and finds the best place a word can be played for the maximum amount of points. The standard Words With Friends® game board is the same size as the Scrabble® board. The standard grid is 15 squares by 15 squares, adding up to squares in total. Some additional game modes, like the Solo Challenge, use a smaller 11 x 11 game board ( squares) for a tighter, faster-paced game. The Facebook Messenger version of Words With Friends uses an 11x11 board like Words With Friends Fast Play, but has a slightly different bonus layout. To solve Messenger games on Scrabulizer, please use our Words With Friends on Messenger game design. Words With Friends Fast Play can be played using the Words With Friends app on: Facebook.
