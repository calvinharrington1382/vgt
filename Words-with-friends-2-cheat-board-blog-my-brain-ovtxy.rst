This Scrabble Cheat Board is a fun tool enabling you to create words from your tiles that will garner you the highest number of points. And you don’t have to be a genius to use it. To use this Scrabble Solver, simply enter in all the tiles that you currently have on your Scrabble board. You can use the arrow keys to navigate quickly. The standard Words With Friends® game board is the same size as the Scrabble® board. The standard grid is 15 squares by 15 squares, adding up to squares in total. Some additional game modes, like the Solo Challenge, use a smaller 11 x 11 game board ( squares) for a tighter, faster-paced game. Click Go to run the Matching With Friends Cheat tool; In the result, the three tile sets would be marked as 1, 2, 3. Follow the result, rotate and place accordingly. Click Reset to clear the board and start over. You might also like our: Words With .
